	<li> Each challenge has a pre-determined score.</li> <br>
	<li>A team would be "the winning team" if that team submits all the problems with the least time complexity.</li><br>                 
	<li> In case some team could not come up with the solution with least time complexity then that team's score depends on the number of test cases every code submission successfully passes.</li><br>
	<li> If a team submits more than one solution per challenge, then the teamâ€™s score will reflect the highest score achieved. In a game challenge, the team's score will reflect the last code submission.</li><br>
	<li> Teams are ranked by score. If two or more teams achieve the same score, then the tie is broken by the total time taken to submit the last solution resulting in a higher score.</li><br>
